# Task:
You are given a fossil description and a list of updated information. Your task is to replace the statement of specific feature in the description with the corresponding statement from the updated information. Refer to the two examples below for guidance.

# Guidelines:
1. The description contains tags like <size>, </size>, etc. that mark the specific feature being described.
2. Replace any approximate value and numerical range in the description with the exact values provided
3. If some feature given in updated information is not mentioned in the description, add the feature with the corresponding value and tag from the updated information
4. For sequence numbers in the updated information, including thickness by volution and heights of volution/whorl, ensure that the processed description includes these sequence numbers in the corresponding feature sections if they are given.
5. Your response should contain only a modified description, without any additional analysis or using any brackets for additional explanations.
