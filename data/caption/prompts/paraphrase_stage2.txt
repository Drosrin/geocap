Task:
You are provided with a description of a fossil image, please paraphrase the description. Refer to the example below for guidance.

Guidelines:
1. The description contains tags like <size>, </size>, <shape>, </shape> etc. that mark the specific feature being described. Do NOT change any tag while paraphrasing.
2. Maintain scientific accuracy and academic style. Feature terms must not be replaced. For adjectives, only synonyms with identical semantic meaning are permitted.
3. Your response should contain only the paraphrased description, without any additional statements or explanations.
